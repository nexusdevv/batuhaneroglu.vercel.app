# Next.js 15.0: New Features and Performance Improvements

Next.js 15.0 has arrived with innovations that are creating a lot of excitement in the web development world. Here are the key features and improvements in the latest version of this powerful framework.

## Turbopack: Faster Compilation Times

One of the most notable improvements in Next.js 15.0 is that Turbopack is now stable. Written in Rust, Turbopack runs 10 times faster than webpack and significantly improves the local development experience. This means significant gains in compilation times for developers working on large projects.

```javascript
// next.config.js - To enable Turbopack:
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: true
  }
}
```

The advantages of Turbopack include:
- Incredibly fast compilation times
- Smart caching
- Only compiles files that change
- Lower memory usage

## React Server Components: Full Integration

React Server Components (RSC) are now at the heart of Next.js. This technology seamlessly combines server-rendered components with interactive client-side components. As a result, initial loading times are accelerated and the user experience is improved. With Next.js 15.0, you can take advantage of the full potential of RSC.

```jsx
// Server component
export default async function BlogPost() {
  const post = await fetchBlogPost(); // You can fetch data directly on the server side
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client component */}
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}

// Client component
'use client';
function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>
      Like ({likes})
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Enhanced Image Optimization

The Next.js Image component is now smarter and more efficient. In the new version, automatic image resizing and format conversion capabilities have been improved. Also, a new blur-up technique offers a better user experience while images are loading.

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function PhotoGallery() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Image
        src="/photos/landscape.jpg"
        width={1200}
        height={600}
        alt="Landscape photo"
        placeholder="blur" // Blur-up technique
        blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..." // Can be generated automatically
        quality={85} // Quality setting
        formats={['webp', 'avif']} // Automatic conversion for modern formats
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Middleware Improvements

Middleware is now more powerful and flexible. With new APIs, you can more easily manipulate, redirect, or block requests. This will be very useful in scenarios such as authentication, authorization, and A/B testing.

```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  
  // Redirect to login page if user is not authenticated
  if (url.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard') && !isAuthenticated(request)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));
  }
  
  // For A/B testing
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    url.searchParams.set('variant', 'B');
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }
  
  // Modify headers
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('x-custom-header', 'my-value');
  
  return response;
}

// Make it run only on specific paths
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
};
```

## Automatic Code Splitting and Tree Shaking

Next.js 15.0 brings significant improvements in automatic code splitting and tree shaking. Bundle sizes are optimized and only truly needed code is loaded. This significantly reduces page loading times, especially for mobile users.

```jsx
// Only loads when the user clicks
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false // Will be loaded on the client side, no SSR
});

export default function Page() {
  const [showHeavyComponent, setShowHeavyComponent] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowHeavyComponent(true)}>
        Show Heavy Component
      </button>
      
      {showHeavyComponent && <HeavyComponent />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Enhanced TypeScript Support

TypeScript integration is now more seamless. Next.js 15.0 supports all features of TypeScript 5.0 and provides better type inference. This increases code safety and improves the development experience.

```typescript
// For better typing
import { GetServerSideProps, InferGetServerSidePropsType } from 'next';

interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<{
  post: Post;
}> = async (context) => {
  const post = await fetchPost(context.params?.id as string);
  return { props: { post } };
};

export default function BlogPost({
  post,
}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {
  // post variable will automatically be of type Post
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Data Mutation APIs

Next.js 15.0 makes the best use of React's new APIs such as `useOptimistic` and `useTransition`. This makes form submissions and data mutations more fluid.

```jsx
'use client';

import { useOptimistic, useTransition } from 'react';
import { updateTodo } from '@/actions/todos';

export default function Todo({ todo }) {
  const [optimisticTodo, setOptimisticTodo] = useOptimistic(
    todo,
    (state, newTitle) => ({ ...state, title: newTitle })
  );
  
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.target);
    const newTitle = formData.get('title');
    
    // Optimistically update UI for better UX
    startTransition(async () => {
      setOptimisticTodo(newTitle);
      await updateTodo(todo.id, newTitle);
    });
  }
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input 
        name="title" 
        defaultValue={optimisticTodo.title} 
        disabled={isPending}
      />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
